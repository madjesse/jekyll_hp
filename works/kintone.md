The Context<br>
## "Can You Make A Bot to Help Me With The Job?"
So I explored to see which parts of our work took the most time and could be automated and realized that a major proportion of our daily work involved using our office system. This is a WEB application where we post news and information, store our students' training records and communicate among staff about issues to be addressed. With further research, I found that many of the tasks on the system can be automated using Python and decided to build a "bot", an app, to help my colleagues out.
