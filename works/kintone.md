## "Can you make a bot to help me with the job?"

Our company is growing fast but we are heavily understaffed. Overwhelmed by the large amount of daily work, my colleagues asked me if I could make a robot of some kind to automate part of their job. <br>
So I explored to see which parts of our work took the most time and could be automated and realized that a major proportion of our daily work involved using our office system. This is a WEB application where we post news and information, store our students' training records and communicate among staff about issues to be addressed.<br>
This was the beginning of the project and I set out to do some research and come up with ideas for the potential app.<br>

<p class="tag" markdown="1">*The Observation*</p>
## How are the tasks done by hand?

To understand the problem better and identify areas for automation, I observed my colleagues doing the tasks in question by hand as they usually did. Here is a summary of the work flow:

## The Problem

The problem I identified here was that the manual work flow was not only time-consuming but physically and mentally exhausting. It involved a lot of clicks and page navigations which were tedious and could have been automated entirely.

## The Goal

To build an app which does the tedious tasks for my colleagues and which has easy-to-understand graphic interface in order for non-programmers to use it.
The intended audience was our company's staff.

### - My Role

I was in charge of every bit of the project and was responsible for the whole process of research, design, coding, tests and deployment.
