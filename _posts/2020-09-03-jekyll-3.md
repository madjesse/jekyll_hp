## Build Your Personal HP With Jekyll - 3
In this 3-part tutorial, I will walk you through the basics of Jekyll, a static site generator, and build a real functional page with it.
In part 1, I will introduce Jekyll to you and show you how to scaffold a Jekyll project.
In part 2, I will focus on introducing key concepts of Jekyll, like frontmatter, include and post.
In part 3, we will polish our simple homepage with Bootstrap and complete our project.

So, let's get started!
(introduce Jekyll and its value in web development)
Jekyll is a static site generator which makes building a production website easy and fast. Static site simply means that all the files used by a site is ready and served directly from server without calling database or generating dynamic contents. This makes statics sites load really fast and much faster than a dynamic site.
Also, conventionly, sites like your blog rely on database and are normally built with CMS. With Jekyll, however, you can build a blog of the same quality without even touching a database.
Combined with Github hosting, you can build your site without worrying about server and the whole thing is free!
